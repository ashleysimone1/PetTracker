This is Pet Tracker!

Pet Tracker is a Marcy Lab School assignment in which users are able to add "pets" using the Pet Submit Form.

After a user submits a new pet entry, that pet is added to the pet database (held in the /allPets directory) and all of these pets are displayed on the main webpage in our PetList view. 

This application was created using HTML and CSS. I used DOM manipulation to generate the new cards in our petList. The database was created and managed using PostgresSQL and Knex to generate new entries into our petList.

To use the app, add your pets using our form and watch how they generate on your personalized PetList!
